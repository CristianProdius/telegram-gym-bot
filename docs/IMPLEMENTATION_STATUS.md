## üìà Progress Summary

| Category | Completion | Items Complete | Items Total |
|----------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Core Features | 100% | 28 | 28 |
| Advanced Analytics | 40% | 2 | 5 |
| Data Export | 30% | 1 | 4 |
| Personal Records | 50% | 2 | 4 |
| Custom Routines | 60% | 2 | 5 |
| Social Features | 0% | 0 | 5 |
| Nutrition | 0% | 0 | 5 |
| **Overall** | **~65%** | **35** | **56** |

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Export functionality not connected** - Export service exists but handlers not implemented
2. **Charts not rendering** - Matplotlib charts need async handling
3. **PR detection incomplete** - Algorithm for automatic PR detection needs work
4. **Routine UI missing** - Backend ready but no UI for routine creation

## üéØ Next Sprint Priorities

### High Priority
1. Complete data export functionality (Excel, PDF, CSV)
2. Implement progress charts and visualizations
3. Finish personal records system
4. Add routine creation UI

### Medium Priority
1. Add more exercises to database
2. Implement workout templates
3. Add body measurements tracking
4. Create admin commands

### Low Priority
1. Social features
2. Nutrition tracking
3. Wearable integrations
4. Voice commands

## üíª Technical Debt

- [ ] Increase test coverage from 60% to 80%
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add caching layer
- [ ] Document API endpoints

## üìä Metrics

- **Code Quality**: B+ (Good structure, needs more tests)
- **Performance**: A- (Fast response times, efficient queries)
- **User Experience**: B+ (Smooth flow, needs more features)
- **Stability**: A (No crashes, good error handling)
- **Documentation**: B (Good README, needs API docs)

## üöÄ Deployment Status

- **Local Development**: ‚úÖ Fully working
- **Docker**: ‚úÖ Configured and tested
- **Production Bot**: ‚úÖ Running on @profiusgymbot
- **CI/CD**: ‚úÖ GitHub Actions configured
- **Monitoring**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic logging only

## üìù Notes for Developers

1. **Database**: All models are created and working
2. **Services**: Service layer is complete for core features
3. **Handlers**: Main commands implemented, advanced features need handlers
4. **Testing**: Focus on increasing test coverage
5. **Documentation**: API documentation needed

---

**Recommendation**: The bot is production-ready for basic gym tracking. Focus next sprint on completing analytics and export features to provide more value to users.
